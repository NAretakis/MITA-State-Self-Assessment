## Capability Domain: Provider

The Provider capability domain encompasses three related areas; Provider Enrollment, Provider Management, and Provider Termination. 

## Capability Area: Provider Termination

Provider Termination encompasses the processes and systems used to manage the end of provider participation in the Medicaid program, including voluntary terminations, terminations for cause, payment suspensions, and appeals management. This capability area aligns with CMS-Required outcomes PM5 (Termination), PM7 (Appeal), PM15 (Sanctions and Terminations), and PM18 (Payment Suspension).

## Outcomes

### Description
The Outcomes dimension focuses on the results and effectiveness of the provider enrollment process.

### Assessment Questions
1. How effectively are provider terminations managed?
2. How well does the system support the provider appeals process?
3. How efficiently are payment suspensions implemented and managed?
4. How effectively does the system share termination information with other states and Medicare?
5. How well does the system track and report on termination reasons and trends?
6. How are termination notices and communications managed?
