## Capability Domain: Provider

The Provider capability domain encompasses three related areas; Provider Enrollment, Provider Management, and Provider Termination. 

## Capability Area: Provider Enrollment

Provider Enrollment encompasses the processes and systems used to register healthcare providers in the Medicaid program, including application processing, screening, verification, and enrollment decisions.

## Outcomes

### Description
The Outcomes dimension focuses on the results and effectiveness of the provider enrollment process.

### Assessment Questions
1. How efficiently are providers enrolled in the Medicaid program?
2. What percentage of applications are processed within standard timeframes?
3. How effectively does the enrollment process validate provider credentials?

### Maturity Level Definitions

#### Level 1: Initial
Manual provider enrollment process with paper-based applications and limited validation of provider information.

#### Level 2: Repeatable
Basic online enrollment forms with some automated validation, though manual review is still required for most applications.

#### Level 3: Defined
Fully electronic enrollment process with automated validation against multiple sources and self-service status checking.

#### Level 4: Managed
Intelligent workflow with predictive analytics, real-time credential verification, and automated risk assessment.

#### Level 5: Optimized
Continuous monitoring and revalidation with cross-program enrollment coordination and adaptive enrollment requirements based on provider risk.

## Roles

### Description
The Roles dimension addresses the responsibilities and interactions of staff and providers in the enrollment process.

### Assessment Questions
1. How are responsibilities distributed across the enrollment process?
2. What self-service capabilities are available to providers?
3. How effectively do different roles collaborate during the enrollment process?

### Maturity Level Definitions

#### Level 1: Initial
Provider enrollment specialists manually process applications with limited provider self-service capabilities and siloed responsibilities across enrollment steps.

#### Level 2: Repeatable
Providers can submit applications online, staff roles are focused on specific verification tasks, with limited coordination between enrollment teams.`;
